# Learn to code

Content provided by experienced developers based on the suggestions/questions from the audience. The reason(s) for this initiative:

<br />

**Tutorials - the classic way**

- Not maintained with the latest trends and information.
- Is quite hard to find the answer regarding a topic. Usually, we are asking Google for help and we land on StackOverflow. 
- This process is a loop for anyone asking/looking for the same problem

<br />

**Tutorials - the new way**

- No content provided at the beginning. 
- Have a question? Open a new fault using Github issues tracker and you got an answer from a contributor  
- Answers are provided by experienced developers and voted by the audience. 
- The main tutorial is updated once the topic is getting a good answer
- If a topic is getting deprecated, a new issue is opened and content gets an update

<br />
